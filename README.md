This repository contains uncategorized set of 3D models by me. If a
model belongs to a specific project of mine, it's somewhere else.

This is just for general interest and the models may be utterly broken in
recent versions of OpenSCAD and BOSL2.

In case you want to learn OpenSCAD + BOSL2, check some less hacky models in here such as:

* [acer486-jalka](acer486-jalka.scad) (vanilla OpenSCAD)
* [batterie-trennshalter-ikea](batterie-trennshalter-ikea.scad) (BOSL2 + OpenSCAD)
